# Software Failure Tolerance Distributed Appointment Management System 
Distributed Appointment Management System (DAMS) is a designed application used by patients to book appointments in Montreal, Quebec and Sherbrooke Hospitals. Another user, admin is the
administrator who manages all the appointment of the patients. All three cities are the three servers, Montreal, Quebec and Sherbrooke. We have already implemented the DAMS system using RMI, 
CORBA and Web-Services Distributed System Implementation Techniques. As we have all distributed implementation technique of DAMS we now focus to characterize our DAMS system using very important 
Distributed System Characteristic known as Failure Tolerance.

Failure Tolerance is the ability of the distributed system to produce correct results even if certain number of components fail. Why do we need Failure Tolerance in Distributed System? Distributed
System must maintain 100% (most of the time 99.99% practically) availability even if any hardware, software or network fails. Which means if one component fails there must be another component to
provide the backup for the failed component and process the request successfully this is achieved by Replication. Replication is one of the important features of the Distributed Systems and is
implemented by creating multiple replications of the servers known as replicas performing the same functionality as requested by client individually.
In this project, we are designing our DAMS application as Software Failure Tolerance using Active Total Order Replication with Reliable Multicast using Kaashoekâ€™s Protocol.
